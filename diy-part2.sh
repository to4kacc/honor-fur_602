# Run from the root of the source tree (working-directory = openwrt), with the

#
#   <workspace>/openwrt/                     <- source tree (this script's CWD)

# The script is idempotent: re-running it will not duplicate anything.
# Every step fails loudly instead of silently producing a firmware that does

# 3. Network interface mapping
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ImmortalWrt 24.10 mediatek/filogic uses DSA: the port names come straight
# from the DTS (port@0 -> "wan", port@1..3 -> "lan3"/"lan2"/"lan1"), and the
# default case in mediatek_setup_interfaces() already yields
# "lan1 lan2 lan3" + "wan", which is exactly what we want. Likewise the MAC
# addresses are supplied by the DTS via nvmem cells on gmac0 (0x2a) and on
# port@0 (0x24), so no board.d change is required at all.
#
# We therefore deliberately do NOT patch 02_network. The old LEDE-style
# *honor,fur-602* branch (swconfig "eth0.1"/"eth0.2" + add_switch) must NOT be
# carried over into a DSA tree.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Upgrade path
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FUR-602 must take the generic fallback branch `*) nand_do_upgrade "$1"` in
# filogic's platform_do_upgrade(), because our sysupgrade.bin is a sysupgrade
# tar that the bl-mt798x U-Boot expects in the UBI volumes "kernel"/"rootfs".
#
# The ustar/tar validation is NOT in this file: nand_do_upgrade() calls
# nand_do_platform_check() (package/base-files/files/lib/upgrade/nand.sh),
# which detects the tar by looking for `sysupgrade-<board>/CONTROL` inside it
# and then runs `tar xOf - >/dev/null` via nand_verify_tar_file().  So what we
# assert here is (a) the generic fallback still calls nand_do_upgrade, and
# (b) our board is NOT special-cased into a different upgrade path.

# 5. Kernel / build configuration
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The kernel-config part of our fragment is deliberately EMPTY -- see the long
# explanation in filogic.config.append.  In short: upstream keeps tc/qdisc/ifb,
# netfilter, mac80211/mt76 and USB out of the target kernel config on purpose
# and ships them as opt-in kmod packages, and the reference port for this very
# board (hanwckf/immortalwrt-mt798x mt7981/config-5.4) does the same.  Baking
# them in with =y would bloat the kernel and diverge from upstream.
#
# What we DO assert here is that the kmod-selection knobs that make those
# packages actually exist are present in the build config, and that the target
# config still looks the way our assumptions require.
if [ -f "../filogic.config.append" ]; then
	# Re-verify the assumptions the empty kernel fragment relies on.

# CONFIG_ALL_KMODS=y makes *every* kmod package default to `m`, i.e. built and
# published into bin/targets/mediatek/filogic/packages/, while only the packages
# forced to `y` (DEFAULT_PACKAGES + DEVICE_PACKAGES) are installed into the
# firmware image.  That is what lets `opkg install kmod-sched-cake kmod-ifb ...`
# succeed on the device afterwards with a matching kernel ABI, without inflating
# the image.  kmod packages are `tristate` (Type: ipkg), so `m` is legal and
# does NOT mean "install this".
#
# This is applied to the build .config by the workflow; record the intent here
# so the requirement is not silently lost if the workflow is ever rewritten.
